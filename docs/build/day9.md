# Day 9: Test Settings

Loop is just a fancy calculator underneath the hood. The math problems that it is solving depend on some settings that you will be providing it. A good idea is to make sure you do a bit of settings testing before using Loop.

**Basal rates**, if properly set, will keep your blood glucose steady without food present. You can test your basals by having a relaxing set of 4-6 hours without eating at least two hours before you begin the test. Does your blood sugar stay steady? Or do you climb and need a correction? Or do you go low and need to eat? Setting basals is a HUGE important step to setting yourself up for Loop success.

**Insulin Sensitivity Factor** (sometimes called Correction Factor) is how much one unit of insulin will bring down your blood sugar. The higher the value of this setting, the more sensitive to insulin you are. An ISF of 30 means one unit of insulin bring your blood sugar down 30 mg/dL. You can test this setting after you get good basals set and tested. Simply bring yourself to a higher BG with a glucose tab or other small quick carbs. Wait until you see yourself plateau again at the higher BG, then take a correction. Wait 4-6 hours (again no food) and see where your correction lands your blood sugar. Divide the BG drop by the amount of correction insulin you delivered...that’s your ISF. 

**Carb Ratio** is the amount of carbs covered by one unit of insulin. Ideally a good carb ratio will bring your BG back to starting point within 2-3 hours* of the meal. (*High fat/protein meals may cause BGs to be impacted longer.) If you are spiking higher than you’d like after a meal but still coming back to starting BG, consider prebolusing your meal by 15-20 minutes rather than changing carb ratio.

If you’re fascinated by this topic, read the book <i>Think Like A Pancreas</i> for a really great discussion. Finally remember settings can change periodically. Hormone cycles, steroids, illness, etc may lead to a [need to change settings](https://kdisimone.github.io/looptips/settings/adjust/).
