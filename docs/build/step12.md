# Step 12: Meet the Community

!!!danger "Time Estimate"
    * Looped Group: 5 minutes
    * Zulipchat: 10 minutes

!!!info "Summary"
    * Be respectful
    * Be helpful
    * Use the search tools in Looped, Zulipchat, and Loopdocs

!!!warning "FAQs"
    * **"I'm worried I'll ask a stupid question"** Don't worry about that...instead just focus on asking a **thorough** question. A thorough question explains what you've already tried or read, has screenshots of what you are confused by, and any other details that you can provide.

There's a whole wonderful community of people already Looping and willing to help you through the process. You can find them in two main areas; [Looped group in Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheLoopedGroup/?fref=nf) and [Zulipchat](https://loop.zulipchat.com).

How can you make the most of those experiences?
