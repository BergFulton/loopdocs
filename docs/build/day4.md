# Step 4: Order a RileyLink

This is an easy step. You need to order a RileyLink from the [GetRiley website](https://getrileylink.org). 

The RileyLink is a non-optional part of the Looping gear. Why do you need it? RileyLink is a communication bridge between the pump and your Loop app on your phone. The RileyLink speaks Bluetooth to your iPhone on one side, and speaks Radio Frequency to your pump on the other side.  Without the RileyLink, the pump cannot receive commands from the Loop app.

There are two types of RileyLinks; [one for Omnipod](https://getrileylink.org/product/rileylink433) users and [one for Medtronic](https://getrileylink.org/product/rileylink916) users. Order the RileyLink specifically for the pump you'll be Looping with. 

Once you get your RileyLink in the mail, you'll need to assemble it carefully. Tips to assembly:
    * The lipo battery plug is the most difficult part of assembly. It is a tight fit and many people give up too soon before the plug is actually in far enough. Make sure you use this picture as a guide.
    * Do not over-tighten the screw
    * When sliding the board and battery into the case, check out this video to help you.

!!!danger "Time Estimate"
    * 15 minutes to order a RileyLink
    * 15-20 minutes to assemble the RileyLink once you get it in the mail

!!!warning "FAQs"
    * **"What happens if I lose my RileyLink or walk away from it?"** Good question...answered [here](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/rileylink-faqs/#what-happens-if-i-walk-away-from-my-rileylink).
    * **"Can I use an Omnipod RileyLink with a Medtronic pump? or vice versa?"** Good question...answered [here](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/rileylink-faqs/#what-will-happen-if-you-use-a-916mhz-antenna-rileylink-with-an-omnipod-or-vice-versa).
    * **"Can I swap out RileyLinks at any time?"** Yes, you can. RileyLinks can be replaced quite simply without needing to start a new pod or rebuild Loop app. There's a place in Loop settings that you'd simply find your new RileyLink's name and turn "on" the Bluetooth connection to start using it."
    * **"How close does the RileyLink need to be to me? Do I have to carry it with me?"** Good questions...answered [here](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/rileylink-faqs/#do-i-have-to-carry-the-rileylink-everywhere).
    * **"Why is it named RileyLink?"** Riley is the name of Pete Schwamb's daughter and he's the guy that created the RileyLink.
    * **"Can I make my own RileyLink?"** Technically yes, however it is not an easy project. You'll need specialized tools and patience. If you want to explore doing that, I'd highly recommend checking out [Zulipchat](https://loop.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/148542-RileyLink) from the other people who have done their own builds successfully over the last several years. Only 3 people have built their own RileyLinks so far...but I guess that technically means it is possble.
