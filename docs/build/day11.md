# Step 11: Meet the Community

There's a whole wonderful community of people already Looping and willing to help you through the process. You can find them in two main areas; [Looped group in Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheLoopedGroup/?fref=nf) and [Zulipchat](https://loop.zulipchat.com).

How can you make the most of those experiences?

!!!danger "Time Estimate"
    * Looped Group: 5 minutes
    * Zulipchat: 10 minutes

!!!warning "FAQs"
    * **"I'm worried I'll ask a stupid question"** Don't worry about that...instead just focus on asking a **thorough** question. A thorough question explains what you've already tried or read, has screenshots of what you are confused by, and any other details that you can provide.

!!!info "Summary"
    * Be respectful...this is all volunteer effort to answer questions and provide support.
    * Be helpful...if you need help, please provide all sorts of details with your question so that the troubleshooters don't have to ask 24 questions just to get an understanding of what your problem is and what you've already tried to do. Screenshots and detailed explanations are invaluable. Avoid using vague words like "it" or vague phrases like "doesn't work"...these aren't super clear or descriptive.
    * Use the search features of all the resources...Loopdocs, Looptips, Zulipchat, and Looped group all have search features built into them. Use a couple search terms related to what you are interested in finding out information on or having trouble with. There is a VERY GOOD CHANCE that the issue has been asked previously and the answer is already waiting for you.
