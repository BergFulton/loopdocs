# Step 3: Compatible Pump
    
This is pretty simple...check that you have a compatible pump to use Loop.

* Medtronic 515 or 715 (any firmware)
* Medtronic 522 or 722 (any firmware)
* Medtronic 523 or 723 (firmware 2.4 or older)
* Medtronic Worldwide Veo 554 or 754 (firmware 2.6A or lower)
* Medtronic Canadian/Australian Veo 554 or 754 (firmware 2.7A or lower)

* Omnipod "Eros" pods

So by default that means any pump NOT mentioned above is NOT compatible. Your Medtronic 530G, 670G, etc are not Loop compatible. Nor is your Tandem, Omnipod DASH, Animas, Roche Combo, Dana-RS, etc.

Wondering how to find where the firmware is listed? Check out [this page's info](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/setup/requirements/mdt-pump/#pump-firmware).

!!!danger "Time Estimate"
    * Omnipod users: 3 seconds to remember how big your PDM is
    * Medtronic users: 10 minutes to put a battery in and look at model and firmware
    * Other pump users: 5 days to email friends asking them to check closets for their old Medtronic pump

!!!warning "FAQs"
    * **"But what about the other pumps?"** Too bad, so sad.
    * **"Can I change the firmware of my Medtronic pump?"** Do you work at Medtronic with insider access to the secret tools and firmware versions to do that? Might lose your job, but I'd bet you could then. We don't have access to that though.

!!!info "Summary"
    * If you have a big clunky PDM with built-in BG meter...you can use your pods for Loop.
    * If you have a slim touch screen android-looking PDM...you can NOT use your pods for Loop.
    * If you have a Medtronic, check the list above to ensure compatible model/firmware.
