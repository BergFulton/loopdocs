# Step 1: Check Computer

!!!warn "Estimated Time to Finish Step 1"
    * 5 minutes, if already have Mojave macOS
    * 30-60 minutes, if need to install macOS updates

You need an Apple computer that has at least macOS 10.14.3 (or newer) installed. This macOS is called Mojave. To find out if you have Mojave installed, click on the little Apple icon in your computer's upper left corner and select the `About this Mac`. It doesn't matter if the computer is a MacBook, iMac, macMini, etc...just so long as it has macOS Mojave. If your computer does not have Mojave, you'll need to check the `Software Update` button on that screen to see if you can update to Mojave.

If your computer does not give you the option to upgrade to Mojave...it is quite possible that Apple has decided your computer is too old to run Mojave. How old is too old? That will depend on your computer model and year as shown below:

!!!warning "Step 1: FAQs"
    * **"Can I use a PC or Windows computer? I don't own an Apple computer."** Yes...sort of. Please see [this FAQ about using Virtual Machine](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/FAQs/#can-i-use-a-virtualmachine-to-build).
    * **"What can I do if my computer is too old to be upgraded to Mojave?"** You could take a look at using [Mojave Patcher](http://dosdude1.com/mojave/), but this is totally on your own and not part of these instructions. Just offering the answer to the FAQ...it is up to you to read about the patcher tool and what risks it may involve for you.
    * **"Can I borrow someone else's Apple computer?"** Yes, please see [this FAQ about borrowing a computer](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/FAQs/#do-i-need-to-own-my-own-apple-computer) to learn more.

    * Check your macOS and make sure it is Mojave.
    * Do use any of the beta macOS versions. (If you don't know what that means, don't worry...that means you aren't using one.)
    * If your macOS is not Mojave, check to see if you can up update your macOS to Mojave and do so.
    * If you cannot upgrade your existing computer to Mojave, you'll need to check into a borrowed computer, patcher tool, or perhaps a new/used computer compatible with Mojave.
    * Check the `Software Update` to see if your Mojave version has any updates available since you first installed it.
