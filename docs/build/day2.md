# Step 2: Compatible iPhone or iPod touch

!!!warn "Estimated Time to Finish Step 2"
    * 5 minutes, if already have iOS 12.2 or newer
    * 20 minutes, if need to update your compatible device to iOS 12.2 or newer
    * 10 minutes, if you need to order a device from Apple website
    * 0 minutes, if you own an Android and won't buy Apple products

Loop is compatible with iPhone and iPod touch devices that can run iOS 12.2 or newer. Therefore, compatible devices include:

* iPhone X, XS, XR, XS Max

* iPhone 8, 8+

* iPhone 7, 7+

* iPhone 6, 6+, 6s, 6s+

* iPhone SE

* iPhone 5s

* iPod Touch, 6th generation or newer

Technically, the iPhone SE and iPhone 5s will likely not be able to update to iOS 13 which will be coming out in the near future. So, they could be incompatible with Loop in the future. Loop users have reported that the iPhone 5s is more prone to be slow on display updates and Dexcom connection is less stable. 

Your phone's iOS version can be found under the Settings app, General, About as shown below.

!!!warning "Step 2: FAQs"
    * **"Can I use an android?"** No.
    * **"But why not?"** Because Loop is written in Apple's Swift language, which does not compile onto Android operating systems.
    * **"Can I use an iPad?"** No. iPads do not support Apple Health and that is an important part of Loop's inner workings.
    * **"Does my iPhone need cell plan?"** No. Loop can work without an internet connection...however you will not have Dexcom Follow data or Nightscout data if you choose to use a device that doesn't have internet connection. In other words Loop will work, but remotely watching followers won't see Looping data unless the Loop device has internet connection.

!!!info "Step 2: Summary"
    * Check your iOS version and make sure you have 12.2 minimum.
    * Do not use any of the beta iOS versions. (Don't worry...if you don't know what that means, then you aren't using one.)
